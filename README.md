## Deliverables & Tech Stacks:

1. Get the colors and Choose a Font (Roboto)
2. Create a directory and name it `css` then inside it create `style.css` file.
3. Inside the `style.css` set the colors and chosen font as CSS variables and its defaults.
4. In the root folder create `index.html` this will be your page or the structure of the page.
5. Import the styling from `/css/style.css` in the `head` tag
6. Import `Bootstrap 5` via CDN
7. Import Google Font's `Roboto` in the `head` tag
8. Open the `index.html` to preview or use the VS Code extension called `Live Server` to create a local server. This will automatically update the changes without having to refresh the page (it does it for you, cool right!?).
9. Inside the `index.html` create a `table` tag and its' structure (`rows` and `columns`), and to merge cells/rows/columns we utilize the built-in attribute of `HTML` which is the `rowspan` and `colspan` by providing an integer value.
10. After structuring, I added some css classes from `Bootstrap` to render a visually and user-friendly table.
11. Then, I added some `CSS` rulesets for customization, like the green headers/description and text alignments. To achieve that I utilized the `:nth-child`, `:not`, and selector specification.
12. That's it!
